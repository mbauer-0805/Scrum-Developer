                    <ul>
                        <li>may also be referred to as Story Test Driven Development (SDD), Specification by Example or Behavior Driven Development (BDD)</li>
                        <li>a collaborative practice where users, testers, and developers define automated acceptance criteria</li>
                        <li>helps to ensure that all project members understand precisely what needs to be done and implemented</li>
                        <li>Failing tests provide quick feedback that the requirements are not being met</li>
                        <li>The tests are specified in business domain terms. Each feature must deliver real and measurable business value: indeed, if your feature doesnâ€™t trace back to at least one business goal</li>
                        <li>writing acceptance tests in advance of implementing the corresponding functionality</li>
                        <li>acceptance tests represent the user's point of view</li>
                        <p></p>
                        <li>The collaborative discussions to generate the acceptance test is often referred to as the three amigos -> representing the three perspectives of customer, development team, testing</li>
